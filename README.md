The Virtue Strengths Survey Plugin
-------------------------------
Description
-------------------------------
This is the plugin used for collecting data on creating a character strengths virtue survey for Restored in Christ.
Eventually the survey will have gone through its evaluation and this repo will contain the different versions required before it reaches its production state. 
Once the data collection part of the project is complete this repo will have the updated and formatted production plugin. 

Known Limitations
-------------------------------
As the status of the project is still in data collection, the fully functional production survey is not ready for public use. 
Thus it will not save results to user accounts and all surveys taken will remain anonymous.
