You can find the keys to these notes throughout the code.
Find the key below for your notes.

#CALC_INC_DEC
We collect survey result objects individually as separate meta keys and values.
Later, we will iterate through all the meta value results to calculate the
increase or decrease of virtue values.

#CALC_INC_DEC_FN
Results are calculated by comparing the two most recent results.
Based on these results, we can determine if the user has increased any score by more than 3% and return the percentage and the score increase in an array.

#VS_RESULT_OBJ
Save the results in a custom object to make it easier to output results in the front end and maintain data integrity.

#VS_STORAGE
Map result numbers to hidden fields on form so we have
results in two places for data integrity.
